# Webex Calling Playbook

Build and configure Webex Calling, admin, device, and messaging APIs programmatically with guided Claude Code assistance.

**Execution pattern:** `wxcli` CLI commands (primary) → `wxcadm` (XSI/E911/CP-API) → raw HTTP (fallback).
The wxcli CLI has 166 command groups covering calling, admin, device, messaging, meetings, and contact center APIs. Raw HTTP docs in `docs/reference/` serve as reference and fallback.

## Quick Start

Use `/agents` and select **wxc-calling-builder**. This is the primary interface for all operations.
The agent walks you through authentication, interviews you about what you want to build, designs
a deployment plan, executes via `wxcli` commands, and verifies the results. **Do not run `wxcli`
commands directly** — the agent handles the full workflow.

**To build or configure Webex Calling:** `/agents` → wxc-calling-builder → describe what you want.

**To migrate from CUCM:** `/agents` → wxc-calling-builder → "Run a CUCM migration" and provide
the CUCM host/credentials. The agent runs the full pipeline: discover → normalize → map → analyze
→ resolve addresses → review decisions → plan → execute → verify. See the CUCM migration section
below for what the pipeline does.

**To debug a failing configuration:** Use `/wxc-calling-debug` (this one is a skill, invoked directly).

**To explain a customer bill or analyse usage reports:** `/agents` → billing-analyst → describe what you need (paste an invoice line, provide an org ID, or drop a CSV path).

### Agent Invocation Pattern

wxc-calling-builder is a **phase-per-invocation** agent. Each major phase runs as a
fresh agent invocation — do not resume agents via `SendMessage` for multi-phase workflows.

**Invocation rules:**
- Always spawn a fresh agent for each phase
- Pass current state in the prompt: project name, current pipeline stage, key context
- The agent reads state from disk on startup and validates against the prompt
- For single-phase work (quick config, one-off query), one invocation is sufficient

**CUCM migration example:**
1. Spawn agent: "Run CUCM discovery for project X against host Y"
2. Agent completes discover + normalize + map + analyze, writes session-state, terminates
3. Spawn fresh agent: "Project X is at ANALYZED. Run decision review and generate report"
4. Agent completes decisions + report, writes session-state, terminates
5. Continue pattern through plan → execute

### Migration Knowledge Base (Opus Advisor)

Structured knowledge base read by the `migration-advisor` agent (Opus) during CUCM migration analysis and decision review. Grounded in the reference docs above + static advisory heuristics. The advisor reads relevant KB docs based on which decision types are present, then applies its own training for edge cases.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/knowledge-base/migration/kb-css-routing.md` | CSS/partition ordering, dial plan decomposition, calling permissions |
| `docs/knowledge-base/migration/kb-device-migration.md` | Device replacement paths, firmware conversion, MPP vs RoomOS |

| `docs/knowledge-base/migration/kb-webex-limits.md` | Platform hard limits, feature gaps, scope requirements (always loaded) |

### Migration Operator Runbooks (Phase 2 Transferability)

Operator-facing reference docs for the CUCM-to-Webex migration tool. Written for a CUCM-literate SE running their first migration. The cucm-migrate skill points operators here for end-to-end pipeline help, per-decision lookups, and tuning recipes.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/runbooks/cucm-migration/operator-runbook.md` | Operator runbook — end-to-end pipeline walkthrough, prerequisites, failure recovery |
| `docs/runbooks/cucm-migration/decision-guide.md` | Decision guide — one entry per DecisionType + advisory pattern, with override criteria |
| `docs/runbooks/cucm-migration/tuning-reference.md` | Tuning reference — config keys, auto-rules, score weights, 5 worked recipes |

**When handling CUCM migration questions:** Read `operator-runbook.md` first for the pipeline walkthrough and `decision-guide.md` for per-decision interpretation. Read `tuning-reference.md` when discussing customer environment shapes (the 5 worked recipes), config tuning, or recurring decision patterns. The `cucm-migrate` skill loads these references automatically when `/cucm-migrate` is invoked; this instruction covers ad-hoc CUCM questions sent to `wxc-calling-builder` or other agents outside the skill flow.

### CLI (wxcli) — Primary Execution Layer

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/wxcli/main.py` | CLI entry point — 166 command groups |
| `src/wxcli/commands/*.py` | All command implementations (raw HTTP pattern) |
| `wxcli --help` | Shows all command groups |
| `wxcli <group> --help` | Shows commands within a group |
| `wxcli <group> <command> --help` | Shows options for a command |
| `specs/webex-cloud-calling.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — calling APIs |
| `specs/webex-admin.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — admin/org management APIs |
| `specs/webex-device.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — device management APIs |
| `specs/webex-messaging.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — messaging/rooms/teams APIs |
| `specs/webex-meetings.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — meetings/video mesh/transcripts APIs |
| `specs/webex-contact-center.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec — contact center APIs (48 groups, 431 commands) |
| `src/wxcli/commands/cleanup.py` | Batch cleanup: inventory + parallel layered deletion |
| `src/wxcli/commands/converged_recordings_export.py` | Hand-written download/export for converged recordings (registered into generated group) |

### CUCM→Webex Migration Tool (All 11 phases complete)

The migration tool is at `src/wxcli/migration/` and wired into the CLI as `wxcli cucm <command>`. **2535 tests passing.** See `src/wxcli/migration/CLAUDE.md` for the full file map, architecture, and pipeline commands. Use `/cucm-migrate` to execute a migration after running the pipeline.

**To run a migration:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `decisions` → `plan` → `preflight` → `export` → then invoke `/cucm-migrate`.

**Migration advisory workflow:** During `/cucm-migrate`, the cucm-migrate skill delegates to the `migration-advisor` agent (Opus) at two points: (1) after pipeline verification, it produces a `migration-narrative.md` with cross-decision analysis, dissent flags, and risk assessment; (2) during decision review, it presents advisories and recommendations with CCIE-level contextual explanation, grounded in the knowledge base at `docs/knowledge-base/migration/`. The static heuristics (`recommendation_rules.py`, `advisory_patterns.py`) remain the backbone — the Opus layer adds interpretation and structured dissent when heuristics are likely wrong. Falls back to mechanical presentation if the advisor agent is unavailable.

**To generate an assessment report:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` (or `discover --from-file`) → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `report --brand "..." --prepared-by "..."`. Does not require plan/preflight/export — the report reads directly from the post-analyze store.

**To generate a per-user diff:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `user-diff`. Does not require plan/preflight/export.

**To generate a user communication notice:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `user-notice --brand "..." --migration-date "..." --helpdesk "..."`. Does not require plan/preflight/export.

### Migration Spec Template

All migration pipeline spec documents must follow the template at `docs/references/migration-spec-template.md`. This applies whether the spec is written interactively via brainstorming, by an agent swarm, or manually. The template is rigid — all 9 sections are required. Sections can be brief for simple specs but cannot be omitted.

### Tools

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tools/postman_parser.py` | Shared dataclasses (`Endpoint`, `EndpointField`) and utilities for the generator pipeline |
| `tools/openapi_parser.py` | Parses OpenAPI 3.0 spec into `Endpoint` objects |
| `tools/command_renderer.py` | Renders `Endpoint` objects into Click command files |
| `tools/field_overrides.yaml` | Table columns, display config, and endpoint overrides |
| `tools/generate_commands.py` | Orchestrates OpenAPI parse → render → write pipeline |
| `tools/postman_spec_diff.py` | Offline Postman↔spec gap diff — compares exported collection JSON against local OpenAPI spec |

### Postman↔Spec Sync

Periodic gap reports live in `docs/reports/postman-spec-sync-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Run the prompt at
`docs/prompts/postman-sync-periodic-report.md` to generate a new one via Postman MCP.

Offline alternative (no MCP needed — export the Postman collection first):
```
python3.11 tools/postman_spec_diff.py \
    --spec specs/webex-cloud-calling.json \
    --postman exported-calling.json \
    --skip-tags tools/field_overrides.yaml
```

Postman fork IDs (wxcli-dev):
- Cloud Calling: `15086833-e014a019-ecc3-4140-ab56-f2e9ccf7f95b`
- Admin: `15086833-5c8bec2d-afcd-4f60-a0ca-cf3bfc798755`
- Device: `15086833-6e026ee0-1f83-4d2b-bba6-b481ab62d0b6`
- Messaging: `15086833-12f8091a-7404-46a7-a1df-61eef3f31435`
- Meetings: `15086833-19910ac6-e687-4b90-b33a-3a02c6f50ce9`
- Contact Center: `15086833-a864a970-27a6-41ad-89d4-cf794012bbcc`

Mock server URLs (public, no auth required — return saved response examples):
- Cloud Calling: `https://f550a728-63cc-4da0-8a6f-e3eda351b9a9.mock.pstmn.io`
- Admin: `https://4ba8e16c-a764-4812-8eb3-e5dc00edcfff.mock.pstmn.io`

- Messaging: `https://c87534f1-1e5c-477e-a249-333815c03415.mock.pstmn.io`

## CLI Status & Known Issues

**166 command groups covering calling, admin, device, messaging, meetings, and contact center APIs.** Nearly all generated from 7 OpenAPI 3.0 specs via `tools/generate_commands.py`. The `converged-recordings` group combines generated CRUD commands with hand-written `download` and `export` commands (`converged_recordings_export.py`).

### CLI test status

166 command groups, all generated from OpenAPI specs. Calling/admin/device/messaging groups live-tested across 4 batch sweeps (2026-03-19 through 2026-03-21). Contact center and meetings groups are newly generated and not yet live-tested. CUCM pipeline tested against live test bed (10.201.123.107) with 2 test bed expansions. See git history for detailed test logs.

### Partner Multi-Org Support

wxcli supports partner/VAR/MSP admins who manage multiple customer orgs with a single partner token.

- **`wxcli configure`** — detects multi-org tokens automatically and prompts for org selection. The selected `orgId` is saved to the config file.
- **`wxcli switch-org`** — change the active target org at any time.
- **`wxcli clear-org`** — remove the saved `orgId` to revert to single-org behavior.
- **`wxcli whoami`** — shows a "Target:" line when an org is set.
- **668 of 804 generated commands** auto-inject `orgId` from config on endpoints that accept it. No flag is required — the parameter is injected transparently.
- **3 hand-coded command files** (licenses, locations, numbers) also inject `orgId` from config. `users` is now an alias for the generated `people` command group.
- The builder agent has a blocking org confirmation step at session start (section 2b) when a partner token is detected.

See `docs/reference/authentication.md` (Partner/Multi-Org Tokens section) for full details.

### Known issues

1. **call-controls requires user-level OAuth.** Admin tokens get 400 "Target user not authorized". The CLI now detects this error and prints a tip about needing user-level OAuth.
2. **Complex nested settings need `--json-body`.** The generator skips deeply nested object/array body fields. Commands with nested fields now show an example JSON snippet in `--help` output (e.g., `wxcli user-settings update-call-forwarding --help`).
3. **my-call-settings and mode-management require calling-licensed user.** All `/people/me/*` endpoints return 404 (error 4008) if the authenticated user doesn't have a Webex Calling license. The `my-call-settings` group (120 commands) covers base + UserHub Phase 2/3/4 self-service endpoints. The CLI detects this error and prints a tip.
4. **6 person settings are user-only (no admin path).** Admin tokens get 404. Use `wxcli my-call-settings` with user-level OAuth. See `docs/reference/self-service-call-settings.md` gotchas.
5. **Two path families for person settings.** Classic `/people/{id}/features/` vs newer `/telephony/config/people/{id}/`. Some names differ. See `docs/reference/person-call-settings-behavior.md` (lines 36-54) for the full mapping table.
6. **Workspace `/telephony/config/` settings require Professional license.** Basic workspaces get 405. See `docs/reference/devices-workspaces.md` gotcha #10 for the endpoint-by-license matrix.
7. **Settings endpoints now support table output.** Settings-get commands (show-*) now accept `-o table` and auto-detect columns from the response data. List commands with non-standard response shapes (no `id`/`name` fields) also auto-detect columns.
8. **Customer Assist queues are hidden from default `call-queue list`.** Must pass `--has-cx-essentials true`. See `docs/reference/call-features-additional.md` cross-cutting gotchas.
9. **Supervisor delete returns 204 but supervisor persists.** Workaround: `update-supervisors` with `action: DELETE` on each agent. See `docs/reference/call-features-additional.md` gotchas.
10. **CUCM CallPickupGroup creation with members fails on CUCM 15.0.** Create empty, then assign via `updateLine`. See `src/wxcli/migration/CLAUDE.md` known issues.
11. **Create commands now support `-o json`.** All create commands accept `-o json` to output the full API response as JSON. Default behavior (`-o id`) prints just the created ID.
12. **`virtual-extensions` commands use wrong ID type.** Uses `VIRTUAL_EXTENSION`-encoded IDs but virtual lines use `VIRTUAL_LINE` IDs. `wxcli cleanup` uses raw REST as a workaround. See `docs/reference/virtual-lines.md` Raw HTTP Gotchas #9.
13. **Device config schema is firmware-dependent.** Per-line ringtone was absent on PhoneOS 3.5/3.6 but fixed in 4.1. Offline/expired devices retain a stale schema. See `docs/reference/devices-platform.md` gotchas #10-11.
14. **Contact Center (`cc-*`) commands require CC-scoped OAuth and region config.** See `docs/reference/contact-center-core.md` gotchas #1-3.
15. **Device settings templates are pipeline-only, not named Webex objects.** The migration pipeline generates "templates" for device settings, but Webex has no named template API object for device settings. Settings are applied directly at org, location, or device level via PUT.

### Cleanup Command

`wxcli cleanup run` batch-deletes Webex Calling resources in dependency-safe order.

**Flags:**
- `--scope "Name1,Name2"` — limit to specific locations (by name or ID)
- `--all` — clean up entire org (required if --scope not given)
- `--include-users` — also delete users (off by default)
- `--include-locations` — also delete locations (off by default, includes 90s wait for calling disable propagation)
- `--exclude-user-domains "wbx.ai,corp.com"` — keep users matching these email domains (use with `--include-users`)
- `--dry-run` — show what would be deleted without deleting
- `--max-concurrent N` — parallel deletions per layer (default 5)
- `--force` — skip confirmation prompt

**Deletion order** (13 layers, reverse of creation): dial plans → route lists → route groups → translation patterns → trunks → call features → schedules/operating modes → virtual lines → devices → workspaces → users → numbers → locations.

**Known behaviors:**
- Virtual lines use raw API (not `wxcli virtual-extensions`) due to ID type mismatch bug
- Location deletion requires disabling calling first + 90s propagation wait
- Location delete may still 409 after wait — re-run cleanup to retry
- Calling disable is best-effort — locations where calling is already off are still attempted for deletion
- Phone numbers are removed before location deletion (max 5 per API request, main numbers skipped)
- Call parks and call pickups are enumerated per-location (no org-wide list endpoint)
- Workspaces must be deleted before disable-calling can succeed — API has no location filter, client-side filtering by locationId

### Generator rules

- **Never hand-edit generated files.** Fix bugs by updating `tools/field_overrides.yaml` and regenerating.
- **Never create new hand-written command files** unless adding functionality that the generator cannot produce (e.g., multi-step workflows, file downloads). 3 legacy hand-written files remain (`locations.py`, `numbers.py`, `licenses.py`) — these are a known drift risk that miss generator improvements. `users.py` was retired and replaced with an alias to the generated `people` command group. `converged_recordings_export.py` is a deliberate hand-written extension that registers `download` and `export` commands onto the generated `converged_recordings` group via a `register(app)` pattern. For simple CRUD commands, use the generator. If a generated command needs custom behavior, use `field_overrides.yaml`.
- **`auto_inject_from_config`** — `field_overrides.yaml` supports an `auto_inject_from_config: ["orgId"]` key per endpoint. Parameters listed here are omitted from `--help` and injected automatically from the saved config at runtime. This replaces the older `omit_query_params` approach for `orgId`.
- **Spec files:** 7 OpenAPI 3.0 specs in `specs/` (`webex-cloud-calling.json`, `webex-admin.json`, `webex-device.json`, `webex-messaging.json`, `webex-meetings.json`, `webex-contact-center.json`, `webex-wholesale.json`)
- Regenerate one tag: `PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-cloud-calling.json --tag "Tag Name"`
- Regenerate one spec (all tags): `PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-cloud-calling.json --all`
- Regenerate all specs:
  ```
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-cloud-calling.json --all
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-admin.json --all
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-device.json --all
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-messaging.json --all
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-meetings.json --all
  PYTHONPATH=. python3.11 tools/generate_commands.py --spec specs/webex-contact-center.json --all
  ```
- Reinstall after regen: `pip3.11 install -e . -q`

**Not for:** Quick bug fixes, single-file edits, exploratory research — use normal sessions or subagents.

## Reference Doc Sources

All reference docs are grounded in actual source code and official documentation:

- **wxc_sdk v1.30.0** (github.com/jeokrohn/wxc_sdk) — cloned at `../wxc_sdk_reference/`
- **wxcadm v4.6.1** (github.com/kctrey/wxcadm) — cloned at `../wxcadm_reference/`
- **OpenAPI 3.0 specs** — `specs/webex-cloud-calling.json` (calling), `specs/webex-admin.json` (admin), `specs/webex-device.json` (devices), `specs/webex-messaging.json` (messaging), `specs/webex-meetings.json` (meetings), `specs/webex-contact-center.json` (contact center)
- **Postman collection** (`../postman-webex-collections/webex_cloud_calling.json`) — legacy reference, 22.5MB, 1,079 endpoints
- **developer.webex.com** — Official API docs, guides, and blog posts
- **Cisco Live LTRCOL-2574** — Hands-on provisioning lab

**Execution pattern:** wxcli CLI commands are the primary execution method. Reference docs contain both SDK method signatures (for understanding) and Raw HTTP sections (for fallback). All Raw HTTP sections were added 2026-03-18.

Known bugs found in wxcadm source are documented in the reference docs.

Maintainers: update reference docs when you discover new gotchas or API changes.

## Reference Doc Sync Protocol

This repo contains authoritative reference docs at `docs/reference/` that document every Webex Calling API surface. These docs were built from wxc_sdk and wxcadm source code and serve both the CLI and the playbook agent.

### When you learn something new

Whenever you discover a technical detail through implementation — a gotcha, a correction, an undocumented behavior, a scope requirement, a parameter that works differently than expected — do this:

1. **Check the relevant reference doc first.** Use the See Also links at the bottom of each doc to find related docs. Key docs by area:
   - Provisioning: `docs/reference/provisioning.md`
   - Call features (AA/CQ/HG): `docs/reference/call-features-major.md`, `call-features-additional.md`
   - Person settings: `docs/reference/person-call-settings-*.md` (4 files: handling, media, permissions, behavior) + `self-service-call-settings.md`
   - Location settings: `docs/reference/location-call-settings-*.md` (3 files: core, media, advanced)
   - Devices: `docs/reference/devices-*.md` (4 files: core, dect, workspaces, platform)
   - Routing: `docs/reference/call-routing.md`
   - Auth: `docs/reference/authentication.md`
   - SDK patterns: `docs/reference/wxc-sdk-patterns.md`

2. **If the reference doc is wrong or incomplete**, update it:
   - Fix incorrect method signatures, scopes, or data models
   - Add the gotcha to the doc's Gotchas section (create one if missing)

3. **If the reference doc is right**, move on — no action needed.

4. **If there's no reference doc for what you found**, add it to the closest doc's Gotchas section with a note about which command surfaced it.
